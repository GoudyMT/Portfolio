            <h2>Coding Journey</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">I began my true coding journey in late December of 2023...</p>
            <div class="full-text">
                <p>
                    I began my coding journey in late December of 2023. Since starting online college in 2020, I've been aiming to earn a BA in Computer Science. My first college coding course made it clear that I had a significant learning
                     curve ahead, as I had no prior knowledge of any coding language. However, I embraced this learning opportunity, realizing that my flexible schedule allowed me to pursue coding independently. That's when I discovered Codecademy.
                      I had known about it for some time but hadn't been able to start due to my busy military life. Finally, with the time and means to pursue my interest, I began the Full Stack Engineering course on December 30th, 2023.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I firmly believe in consistent growth over time. The user interface on Codecademy, which shows a percentage of course completion after each task, perfectly aligns with this belief. It enables me to track my progress and set a
                     daily goal of 1% completion. My coding journey has been as fulfilling as I had hoped. Currently, I'm 29% through the Full Stack Engineering course and aim to complete it by March. Although I'm about 4% behind my daily goal,
                      I see this as motivation to either catch up or get ahead.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My plan is to explore most of the Engineering courses on Codecademy to find the path that interests and satisfies me the most. I aspire to be proficient in numerous computer languages, and Codecademy has been an excellent
                     starting point for someone with no prior experience. Each new course boosts my confidence, and I intend to update this page upon completing the Full Stack Engineering course. I say 'when' because I have no doubts about
                      finishing it.

            <h2>Military Journey</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">Taking us on a trip back to 2017...</p>
            <div class="full-text">
                <p>
                    I enlisted in the United States Navy in July 2017, originally considering the Air Force. However, after scoring surprisingly well on the ASVAB test, a chance encounter with some welcoming Navy personnel led me to sign up,
                     marking the beginning of an unexpected yet rewarding journey.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My military training commenced with boot camp during the peak summer heat, featuring intense initial routines like staying awake for 48 hours to synchronize our internal clocks. Although I fainted early on, likely due to
                     dehydration, this incident revealed the humane side of our stern instructors. Assigned the role of Table Petty Officer, a seemingly trivial position, I ensured our living quarters remained inspection-ready. Despite starting
                      at the bottom rank of E-1, I was unexpectedly promoted to E-3 near the end of boot camp due to meritorious performance, bypassing the standard progression.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Post-boot camp, my technical training began at Great Lakes, often humorously called 'Great Mistakes.' My course, a 'Filter Course,' was designed to weed out those unable to keep pace with an intensive curriculum on electronics.
                     Opting to study over the holidays, I successfully navigated this grueling eight-week course amidst Chicago's harsh winter.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Next was 'A' school, a six-month program focusing on essential technical skills like RADAR and communications. Graduating in the summer of 2018, I was automatically advanced to E-4 as per my contract. With some say in my next
                     destination, I chose Satellite Communications in San Diego, CA, leading to further specialized training ('C' schools) for commercial and Navy satellite systems.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In January 2019, I joined the USS John P. Murtha, embarking on a four-and-a-half-year tenure that included two full deployments, humanitarian aid missions, joint operations, and support for NASA's capsule recovery missions.
                     This period was a profound mix of challenges, experiences, and travels, highlighting the stark contrasts between the comforts of home and the realities of less-developed nations.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Transitioning to shore duty at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, my focus shifted to maintaining RADAR and communications gear, a less demanding role compared to ship life. This position allowed me to pursue my true interests:
                     college and coding. As I approach my discharge date on January 18th, 2027, I plan to complete my college education through Southern New Hampshire University and explore various engineering courses through Codecademy, aiming to
                      contribute to meaningful technological advancements.
