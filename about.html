            <h2 class="section-title">Coding Journey</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">Oh the things you will learn...</p>
            <div class="full-text">
                <p>
                    I started seriously coding in late December of 2023. Since starting online college in 2020, I've been aiming to earn a BA in Computer Science. My first college coding course made it clear that I had a significant learning
                     curve ahead, as I had no prior knowledge of any coding language. However, I embraced this learning opportunity, realizing that my flexible schedule allowed me to pursue coding independently. That's when I discovered Codecademy.
                      I had known about it for some time but hadn't been able to start due to my busy military life. Finally, with the time and means to pursue my interest, I began the Full Stack Engineering course on December 30th, 2023.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I firmly believe in consistent growth over time. The user interface on Codecademy, which shows a percentage of course completion after each task, perfectly aligns with this belief. It enables me to track my progress and set a
                     daily goal of 1% completion. My coding journey has been as fulfilling as I had hoped. Currently, I'm 29% through the Full Stack Engineering course and aim to complete it by March. Although I'm about 4% behind my daily goal,
                      I see this as motivation to either catch up or get ahead.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My plan is to explore most of the Engineering courses on Codecademy to find the path that interests and satisfies me the most. I aspire to be proficient in numerous computer languages, and Codecademy has been an excellent
                     starting point for someone with no prior experience. Each new course boosts my confidence, and I intend to update this page upon completing the Full Stack Engineering course. I say 'when' because I have no doubts about
                      finishing it.

            <h2 class="section-title">Military Journey</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">Taking us on a trip back to 2017...</p>
            <div class="full-text">
                <p>
                    I enlisted in the United States Navy in July 2017, originally considering the Air Force. However, after scoring surprisingly well on the ASVAB test, a chance encounter with some welcoming Navy personnel led me to sign up,
                     marking the beginning of an unexpected yet rewarding journey.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My military training commenced with boot camp during the peak summer heat, featuring intense initial routines like staying awake for 48 hours to synchronize our internal clocks. Although I fainted early on, likely due to
                     dehydration, this incident revealed the humane side of our stern instructors. Assigned the role of Table Petty Officer, a seemingly trivial position, I ensured our living quarters remained inspection-ready. Despite starting
                      at the bottom rank of E-1, I was unexpectedly promoted to E-3 near the end of boot camp due to meritorious performance, bypassing the standard progression.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Post-boot camp, my technical training began at Great Lakes, often humorously called 'Great Mistakes.' My course, a 'Filter Course,' was designed to weed out those unable to keep pace with an intensive curriculum on electronics.
                     Opting to study over the holidays, I successfully navigated this grueling eight-week course amidst Chicago's harsh winter.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Next was 'A' school, a six-month program focusing on essential technical skills like RADAR and communications. Graduating in the summer of 2018, I was automatically advanced to E-4 as per my contract. With some say in my next
                     destination, I chose Satellite Communications in San Diego, CA, leading to further specialized training ('C' schools) for commercial and Navy satellite systems.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In January 2019, I joined the USS John P. Murtha, embarking on a four-and-a-half-year tenure that included two full deployments, humanitarian aid missions, joint operations, and support for NASA's capsule recovery missions.
                     This period was a profound mix of challenges, experiences, and travels, highlighting the stark contrasts between the comforts of home and the realities of less-developed nations.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Transitioning to shore duty at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, my focus shifted to maintaining RADAR and communications gear, a less demanding role compared to ship life. This position allowed me to pursue my true interests:
                     college and coding. As I approach my discharge date on January 18th, 2027, I plan to complete my college education through Southern New Hampshire University and explore various engineering courses through Codecademy, aiming to
                      contribute to meaningful technological advancements.

                <h5>Fitness</h5>
                <p>
                    I am committed to a healthy lifestyle, with fitness playing a significant role in both my physical and mental well-being.
                     Setting goals in my fitness journey not only enhances my physical fitness but also provides motivation and focus for my daily
                      tasks. Since January 2018, I've been dedicated to consistently improving my strength, and more recently, I've shifted my
                       focus towards endurance training. I'm particularly proud of my current personal best of running 17 miles, and I'm eagerly
                        working towards completing a full marathon by the third week of March 2024.
                </p>    
                <h5>Reading</h5>
                <p>    
                    In addition to my fitness regimen, I'm an avid reader, aiming to finish at least one book weekly. While my college commitments
                     and coding studies on Codecademy have recently limited my reading time, I'm looking forward to diving back into my extensive
                      reading list when my schedule allows.
                </p>    
                <h5>Video Games</h5>    
                <p>    
                    When I'm not engrossed in my studies, fitness routines, or reading, I unwind by playing video games. I particularly enjoy
                     first-person shooters and the occasional role-playing game, providing a perfect balance of action and immersive storytelling
                      in my leisure time.
